# LLCSParallel
This code is written in C. 

Four different implementations of LLCS function. (located in implementation.h)

X.in , Y.in: two large input strings

Serial version: normal implementation.

Anti-diagonal version: a different serial approach

Explicit tasks: parallel LLCS using OpenMp with Explicit tasks

Taskloop: parallel LLCS using OpenMp with Taskloop
